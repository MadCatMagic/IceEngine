# IceEngine
a WIP simple game engine

At the moment it contains: 
* framework for sprite rendering
* binds or classes for various openGL objects
* basic 3D rendering support
* basic UI system
* support for 2D textures

All of these features are subject to change whenever I get around to improving them
